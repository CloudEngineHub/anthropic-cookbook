    "The Anthropic API features citation support that enables Claude to provide detailed citations when answering questions about documents. Citations are a valuable affordance in many LLM powered applications to help users track and verify the sources of information in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Citations are supported on:\n",
    "* `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`\n",
    "* `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022`\n",
    "\n",
    "The citations feature is an alternative to prompt-based citation techniques. Using this featue has the following advantages:\n",
    "- Prompt-based techniques often require Claude to output full quotes from the source document it intends to cite. This increases output tokens and therefore cost.\n",
    "- The citation feature will not return citations pointing to documents or locations that were not provided as valid sources.\n",
    "- While testing we found the citation feature to generate citations with higher recall and percision than prompt based techniques.\n",

      "- Train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences\n",
      "- Use \"RL from AI Feedback\" (RLAIF) [3]\n",

      "\n",
      "- They are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them\n",
